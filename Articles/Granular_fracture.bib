We consider a two-dimensional semi-infinite slab with an imposed temperature drop on its free surface. The damage model is formulated in the framework of the variational theory of rate-independent processes based on the principles of irreversibility, stability and energy balance. In the case of a sufficiently severe shock, we show that damage immediately occurs and that its evolution follows first a fundamental branch without localization. Then it bifurcates into another branch in which damage localization will take place finally to generate cracks. The determination of the time and mode of that bifurcation allows us to explain the periodic distribution of the so-initiated cracks and to calculate the crack spacing in terms of the material and loading parameters. Numerical investigations complete and quantify the analytical results.},

  abstract  = {Local damage models with softening needs localization limiters to preserve the mathematical and physical consistency. In this paper we compare the properties of strain-gradient and damage-gradient regularizations. Gradient-damage models introduce a quadratic dependency of the dissipated energy on the gradient of the damage field and are nowadays extensively used as phase-field approximation of brittle fracture. Their key feature is to provide a smeared approximation of a crack as a band of localized damage with a finite energy dissipation per unit of surface, that can be identified with the fracture toughness of the Griffith model. Strain gradient models introduce a quadratic dependence of the elastic energy on the gradient of the strain field. A similar term can be physically interpreted as the presence in the material of linear, but nonlocal, stiffnesses, that can be eventually be affected by damage. Despite this attractive interpretation, we have found that strain-gradient regularized models can hardly be used to approximate brittle fracture, because smeared cracks with non-vanishing and finite dissipated energies are hardly obtained. Our analysis is based on variational models and focuses on the one-dimensional traction problem.},

  abstract = {Phase-field models, sometimes referred to as gradient damage or smeared crack models, are widely used methods for the numerical simulation of crack propagation in brittle materials. Theoretical results and numerical evidences show that they can predict the propagation of a pre-existing crack according to Griffith’ criterion. For a one-dimensional problem, it has been shown that they can predict nucleation upon a critical stress, provided that the regularization parameter be identified with the material’s internal or characteristic length. In this article, we draw on numerical simulations to study crack nucleation in commonly encountered geometries for which closed-form solutions are not available. We use U- and V-notches to show that the nucleation load varies smoothly from that predicted by a strength criterion to that of a toughness criterion when the strength of the stress concentration or singularity varies. We present validation and verification numerical simulations for both types of geometries. We consider the problem of an elliptic cavity in an infinite or elongated domain to show that variational phase field models properly account for structural and material size effects. Our main claim, supported by validation and verification in a broad range of materials and geometries, is that crack nucleation can be accurately predicted by minimization of a nonlinear energy in variational phase field models, and does not require the introduction of ad-hoc criteria.},

Revisiting brittle fracture as an energy minimization problem. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 46 (8), 1319–1342], we define the loss of stability of the elastic response of the body as the criterion of initiation of cracks. The result is very sensitive to the choice of the surface energy density. On one hand, if we adopt the Griffith assumption, then the elastic state is generally always stable. On the other hand, in the case of a surface energy of the Barenblatt type, i.e. a surface energy depending non-trivially on the jump of the displacement and inducing cohesive forces, the elastic response remains stable only if the stress field does not reach a critical value. In the full three-dimensional context of an isotropic material, we prove that this yield stress criterion is equivalent to a maximal traction criterion and a maximal shear criterion if the surface energy density is Fréchet differentiable at the origin. When the surface energy density is only Gâteaux differentiable, we obtain a yield stress criterion based on an intrinsic curve in the Mohr diagram. In any case, the domain of the admissible stress tensors is convex, unbounded in the direction of the hydrostatic pressures and depends only on the extreme eigenvalues of the stress tensor.},

On s'intéresse aux modèles d'endommagement de type fragile où la variable d'endommagement scalaire est régie par une loi à seuil.

On peut alors définir naturellement les concepts de durcissement, d'adoucissement et de stabilité. On aboutit ainsi à une formulation basée sur les trois principes physiques d'irréversibilité, de stabilité et de bilan d'énergie, directement généralisable à des modèles non locaux et se prêtant à un traitement mathématique rigoureux.
This Note is devoted to the construction of local brittle damage laws. We first justify by the Drucker–Ilyushin postulate to set their formulation within the framework of Generalized Standard Materials. Accordingly, the strain work becomes a state function whose convexity properties are directly related to the hardening or softening properties of the material. Moreover, the evolution problem can be read as a variational problem which is reinforced so that it finally contains the concepts of stability and of energy conservation.},

The construction of such model follows the variational approach to fracture and proceeds into two stages: (1) definition of the energy; (2) formulation of the damage evolution problem. The total energy of the body is defined in terms of the state variables which are the displacement field and the damage field in the case of quasi-brittle materials. That energy contains in particular gradient damage terms in order to avoid too strong damage localizations. The formulation of the damage evolution problem is then based on the concepts of irreversibility, stability and energy balance. That allows us to construct homogeneous as well as localized damage solutions in a closed form and to illustrate the concepts of loss of stability, of scale effects, of damage localization, and of structural failure. Moreover, the variational formulation leads to a natural numerical method based on an alternate minimization algorithm. Several numerical examples illustrate the ability of this approach to account for all the process of fracture including a 3D thermal shock problem where the crack evolution is very complex.},

In recent years, the interest in the problem of brittle fracture and, in particular, in the theory of cracks has grown appreciably in connection with various technical applications. Numerous investigations have been carried out, enlarging in essential points the classical concepts of cracks and methods of analysis. The qualitative features of the problems of cracks, associated with their peculiar nonlinearity as revealed in these investigations, makes the theory of cracks stand out distinctly from the whole range of problems in terms of the theory of elasticity. The chapter presents a unified view of the way basic problems in the theory of equilibrium cracks are formulated and discusses the results obtained thereby. The object of the theory of equilibrium cracks is the study of the equilibrium of solids in the presence of cracks. However, there exists a fundamental distinction between these two problems, The form of a cavity undergoes only slight changes even under a considerable variation in the load acting on a body, while the cracks whose surface also constitutes a part of the body boundary can expand even with small increase of the load to which the body is subjected.},

Sand and glass beads were wetted and tested in a direct shear cell and under various confining pressures. In parallel, we carried out three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations by using an explicit equation expressing capillary force as a function of interparticle distance, water bridge volume, and surface tension. We show that, due to the peculiar features of capillary interactions, the major influence of water content over the shear strength stems from the distribution of liquid bonds. This property results in shear strength saturation as a function of water content. We arrive at the same conclusion by a microscopic analysis of the shear strength. We propose a model that accounts for the capillary force, the granular texture, and particle size polydispersity. We find fairly good agreement of the theoretical estimate of the shear strength with both experimental data and simulations. From numerical data, we analyze the connectivity and anisotropy of different classes of liquid bonds according to the sign and level of the normal force as well as the bond direction. We find that weak compressive bonds are almost isotropically distributed whereas strong compressive and tensile bonds have a pronounced anisotropy. The probability distribution function of normal forces is exponentially decreasing for strong compressive bonds, a decreasing power-law function over nearly one decade for weak compressive bonds, and an increasing linear function in the range of tensile bonds. These features suggest that different bond classes do not play the same role with respect to the shear strength.},

  abstract  = {Success of a hydraulic fracturing operation depends on the height and width of the induced fractures. One of the critical components controlling fracture size is fracture toughness of the formation. In this work, mode I fracture toughness of Berea Sandstone and Mancos Shale is measured by combining semi-circular bend test (SCB) and digital image correlation (DIC). Experiments were carried out in different notch orientations with respect to bedding. DIC is used to measure full-field displacements and to visualize and quantify fracture process zone (FPZ). Full-field displacements from DIC are utilized in Williams' series solution to extract critical stress intensity factor, or fracture toughness. Accuracy of measuring fracture toughness using DIC displacements depends on area of interest (AOI), field of view (FOV), and the number of terms of solution (N). A parametric study is conducted, allowing to choose an optimal set of these parameters for evaluation of fracture toughness in rock specimens. It is known that fracture toughness values obtained directly from the SCB test, using conventional maximum load method, are underestimated due to the effect of nonlinear behavior caused by the fracture process zone. FPZ length is considered as an increase in the effective crack length. Irwin's correction for effective crack length is utilized to measure fracture toughness values obtained directly from the SCB test that account for the fracture process zone. Fracture toughness values measured using DIC method and Irwin's correction method are in a good match for both Berea Sandstone and Mancos Shale. Both methods show higher fracture toughness for samples in arrester orientation. In addition, the results show that FPZ length in Berea Sandstone is much larger than in Mancos Shale.},

  abstract  = {Digital image correlation is a measurement technique that allows one to retrieve displacement fields ‘separating’ two digital images of the same sample at different stages of loading. Because of its remarkable sensitivity, it is possible to not only detect cracks with sub-pixel opening, which would not be visible but also to provide accurate estimates of stress intensity factors. For this purpose suitable tools have been devised to minimize the sensitivity to noise. Working with digital images allows the experimentalist to deal with a wide range of scales from the atomistic to the geophysical one with the same tools. Various examples are shown at different scales, as well as some recent extensions to three-dimensional cracks based on x-ray Computed micro-tomographic images.},
